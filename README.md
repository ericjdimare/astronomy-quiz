The purpose of this project is for a user to run through a series of questions while being timed. If you answer the question correctly you move on to the next one. If answered incorrectly, subtrect 10 seconds from the current score and move on to the next question. Answer questions until the timer runs out or all are answered. At the end you can save your score.

THe functionality of this project that I used was creating a bunch of DIVs that are hidden and only need to be called at specific times. A timer starts upon starting the quiz followed by the series of questions, iterating through changing classes for correct/incorrect and displaying them appropriately. When you are finished with the quiz, the timer is stopped and is used as the users score.
